# Titanic Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the provided dataset containing passenger information, such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare, I aimed to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival.

## Skills Learned

Through this project, I've gained valuable skills and insights into the world of data science and predictive modeling:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables to make informed decisions during feature selection and modeling.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to better represent underlying patterns in the data.
  
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Exploring various machine learning algorithms and comparing their performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best model.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance using techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.
  
- **Cross-Validation**: Assessing model generalization performance and mitigating overfitting using cross-validation techniques.
  
- **Model Interpretation**: Understanding model predictions through techniques like feature importance analysis and partial dependence plots.
  
- **Deployment**: Deploying machine learning models into production environments, considering scalability, latency, and monitoring.
